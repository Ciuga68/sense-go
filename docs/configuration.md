Considering the conventions mentioned above ***sense-go** comes with a default configuration based on these.

### Inline configuration

(TBD)

### Project configuration
When running in CLI define all configurations in the `sense-go.yml` file, located in the root of your project.

The easiest way to start with your custom configuration is to copy the [default configuration file](src/default-config.yml) and start modifying it.
But keep in mind, following the conventions, you should only need to adapt a few of the default configurations.
