## Purpose

Main purpose of this library is to provide a framework to easily

+ validate
+ package
+ deploy and
+ test

**Visualization Extensions** created for Qlik Sense.

The implementation is a based on the deployment functionality in the [Yeoman Generator for Visualization Extensions](https://github.com/stefanwalther/generator-qsExtension).

The main reason behind creating this library is that I am creating a lot of different visualization extensions for Qlik Sense, but in any of these projects I include some kind of deployment system (so far always using grunt). If I have to make changes to the general deployment approach I have to change every single visualization extension repository, which is not really ideal. So introducing this library centralizes the deployment needs and allows me to re-use a central approach.

Technically speaking sense-go is just a collection of configurable gulp tasks which can be easily re-used when developing your Qlik Sense visualization extensions.

## Deployment by convention

The entire concept follows **conventions** I am using when setting up a project:

```
| PROJECT-ROOT
|-- build           <= all builds, including source code or zipped files
    |-- dev         <= target for the development build
    |-- release     <= target for the release build
|-- docs            <= documentation files, then used by verb
|-- src             <= all source files
    |-- lib
        |-- css     <= see below *
        |-- less    <= less files
| .sense-go.yml     <= sense-go configuration file
| .verb.md          <= verbs readme template
| gulpfile.js       <= gulp file using sense-go
| package.json
```

* If using less files is preferred for a project I keep this folder empty, otherwise all the .css files will be place here

**_sense-go_** works best if you follow these conventions, otherwise everything is configurable, it's just a bit more work to get sense-go running immediately.
