## Installation

**Step 1:** Install sense-go in your project

```js
npm install sense-go --save-dev
```

_Note:_

_Currently you have to save **_sense-go_** locally as a devDependency in your project. It is planned to get **_sense-go_** working as a global dependency, since **_sense-go_** is quite heavy because of the many gulp packages being installed. As an alternative install **_sense-go_** globally and do an `npm link` in your project as for now._

**Step 2:** Install Gulp4, to run your local gulpfile.js

```js
npm install git://github.com/gulpjs/gulp#4.0 --save-dev
```

_Note:_

_The beta of Gulp 4 is used in this project._

**Step 3:** Create a gulpfile.js in the root folder of your project, containing the following minimal code:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var senseGo = require('sense-go');

var userConfig = {
    "packageName": "Your Package Name"
};

senseGo.init( gulp, userConfig,  function (  ) {
  // Your own gulp tasks or task-chains here
  // ...
});
```

Then run **_sense-go_** by:

* Running any of the single gulp commands,
* Run a predefined task chain or
* Define your own tasks/tasks-chains, combine them with pre-configured ones and run them.

## Purpose

Main purpose of this library is to provide a framework to easily

* validate
* package
* deploy and
* test

**Visualization Extensions** created for Qlik Sense.

The implementation is a based on the deployment functionality in the [Yeoman Generator for Visualization Extensions](https://github.com/stefanwalther/generator-qsExtension).

The main reason behind creating this library is that I am creating a lot of different visualization extensions for Qlik Sense, but in any of these projects I include some kind of deployment system (so far always using grunt). If I have to make changes to the general deployment approach I have to change every single visualization extension repository, which is not really ideal. So introducing this library centralizes the deployment needs and allows me to re-use a central approach.

Technically speaking sense-go is just a collection of configurable gulp tasks which can be easily re-used when developing your Qlik Sense visualization extensions.

## Deployment by convention

The entire concept follows **conventions** I am using when setting up a project (working on Qlik Sense visualization extensions or mashups):

```
| PROJECT-ROOT
|-- build           <= all builds, including source code or zipped files
    |-- dev         <= target for the development build
    |-- release     <= target for the release build
|-- docs            <= documentation files, then used by verb
|-- src             <= all source files
    |-- lib
        |-- css     <= see below *
        |-- less    <= less files
| .sense-go.yml     <= sense-go configuration file
| .verb.md          <= verbs readme template
| gulpfile.js       <= gulp file using sense-go
| package.json
```

* If using less files is preferred for a project I keep this folder empty, otherwise all the .css files will be place here

**_sense-go_** works best if you follow these conventions, otherwise everything is configurable, it's just a bit more work to get **_sense-go_** running immediately, but that's definitely NOT the idea behind this project.

## Basic workflow

The workflow of the pre-configured tasks can be summarized as follows:

* You **develop** in the `.src` folder
* Whenever you want to **test or deploy**, use a one-liner in your command line
* To
  - Convert `.less` files to `.css` files
  - Lint, Minify, Ugilify the output
  - Create a .zip file to distribute your visualization extension
  - ... a lot of other neat tasks ... fully customizable ...
* Then the **extension is being deployed**
  - To the local extension directory (Qlik Sense Desktop)
  - Imported to the Qlik Sense Server (using the Qlik Sense Repository API)
  - to other destinations, like via SSH

It is important to mention that you can by 100% re-define the workflow and also all default settings, but the idea of **sense-go** is really to get something up and running across different projects with as little configuration and development work as possible. So choose custom configurations wisely.

## Configuration

Considering the conventions mentioned above ***sense-go** comes with a default configuration based on these.

### Inline configuration

(TBD)

### Project configuration

When running in CLI define all configurations in the `sense-go.yml` file, located in the root of your project.

The easiest way to start with your custom configuration is to copy the [default configuration file](src/default-config.yml) and start modifying it.
But keep in mind, following the conventions, you should only need to adapt a few of the default configurations.

## Tasks

Get a list of all tasks by running

```
gulp --tasks
```

### Deployment

> Deploy to either the Extension folder on your local computer (using Qlik Sense Desktop), upload to a server via ssh or upload to a Qlik Sense Repository using the Qlik Sense Repository (QRS) API.

The following typical deployment tasks are available

### Qlik Sense Desktop

**`deploy:tmpToLocal`**

* Copies all files (except the excluded ones) from the `.mp` directory to the local extension directory, creating a new folder for the current package and eventually deleting any already existing files in the targeted folder.
* Options used:
  - `tmpDir`
  - `localExtensionDir
* Excluded files:
  - `*.less`

Note: The path for the local deployment will be fetched automatically (using [sense-loc](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-loc)), if you want to override the path, use `localExtensionDir`.

### Upload to Qlik Sense server

Upload the zipped visualization extension to a Qlik Sense server (using the Repository API in behind).

(tbd)

### Upload via SSH

**`deploy:toSSH`**

* Deploy the final output via SSH
* Options used:
  - `deployment:enabled`
  - `deployment:host`
  - `deployment:port`
  - `deployment:username`
  - `deployment:password`
  - `deployment:dest`

Note: `deploy:toSSH` has mainly be tested with mobaSSH, using certificates is not tested, yet.

### Bump

> Bumps the version in your package.json file

**`gulp bump:patch`**

* Changes the version in package.json from `  0.2.1` to `  0.2.2`
* Shortcuts: `gulp b` or `gulp b:p`

**`gulp bump:minor`**

* Changes the version in package.json from `  0.2.1` to `  0.3.1`
* Shortcut: `gulp b:min`

**`gulp bump:major`**

* Changes the version in package.json from `  0.2.1` to `  1.0.0`
* Shortcut: `gulp b:maj`

**`gulp bump:version`**

* Set the package.json version to a specific value given by the parameter `--newversion` resp. `--nv`.
* Shortcut: `gulp b:v`
* Example:

```sh
gulp bump:version --newversion=0.1.0
gulp b:v --nv=0.1.0
```

**Possible command line parameters**

**`--tag`**

* Tags the current version of your commit with the newly created version created by any of the bump-tasks.

**`--commit="Your commit message"`**

* Commits all files with the given commit message, if no commit message is defined, "." will be committed as a message.

### Clean

> Cleaning and deleting folders.

**`gulp clean:tmp`**

* Delete the entire `.tmp` directory.
* Options used:
  - `tmpDir`

**`gulp clean:buildDev`**

* Deletes all files in the `./build/dev` directory.
* Options used:
  - `buildDevDir`

**`gulp clean:buildRelease`**

* Deletes all files in the `./build/release` directory.
* Options used:
  - `buildReleaseDir`

**`clean:localExtensionDir`**

* Deletes all files in the project's local extension folder. Only makes sense if working against Qlik Sense Desktop. Disabled if `deployment.toLocal.enabled === true`.
* Options used:
  - `deployment.toLocal.enabled`
  - `deployment.toLocal.extensionBaseDir`

**`clean:tmpIllegal`**

* Clean all files in the `.tmp` directory which are not supposed to be deployed to the extension directory.
* These are all files, except files with the following file extension:
  - `{png,jpg,jpeg,json,qext,txt,js,css,eot,svg,ttf,woff,html,htm,wbl,svg}`

### Copy

> Copy files to a specific directory on your system.

**`gulp copy:toTmp`**
* Copies all files (except the excluded ones) from the `src` folder to the `.tmp` folder.
* Options used:
  - `srcDir`
  - `tmpDir`

* Excluded files:
  - `*.less`

**`copy:tmpToDev`**
* Copies all files (except the excluded ones) from the `.tmp` folder to `.\build\dev` folder.
* Options used:
  - `tmpDir`
  - `buildDevDir`

* Excluded files:
  - `*.less`

**`copy:tmpToRelease`**
* Copies all files (except the excluded ones) from the `.tmp` folder to `.\build\release` folder.
* Options used:
  - `tmpDir`
  - `buildReleaseDir`

* Excluded files:
  - `*.less`

### Minification/Optimization

> Several minification tasks

**`minify:html:tmp`**

* Minifies all htm/html files in the `tmp` folder
* Options used:
  - `tmpDir`

**`minify:json:tmp`**
* Minify .json & .qext files
* Options used:
  - `tmpDir`

### Import

> Import files to the deployment.

`gulp import`
The main use-case behind this task is to be able to import "external" files from external dependencies (e.g. node_modules or bower) into the .tmp directory to use them in the solution.

Define the file you want to import in your `sense-go.yml` file as follows:

Example:

```
import:
  files:
    - ["./node_modules/d3/d3.min.js", "./.tmp/lib/external/d3/d3.min.js"]
    - ["./node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js", "./.tmp/lib/external/moment/moment.min.js"]
```

### Less

> Converts .less files to .css files.

All less tasks automatically create a sourcemap (using [gulp-sourcemaps](http://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps)) and autoprefix (using [gulp-autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer))

**`gulp less:reduce`**

* Uses `/src/less/main.less`, resolves all its dependencies and creates `/.tmp/css/main.css`
* Options used:
  - srcDir
  - tmpDir

**`gulp less:each`**

* Converts every `.less` file from the source directory to a corresponding .css file in the .tmp directory.
* Options used:
  - srcDir
  - tmpDir

### Replace

> Replaces string patterns in text files across your project.

**Usage**
* Use @@ to prefix the key to be replaced with a given value in the source code
* Replacements will only be performed in the following file types:
  - .html
  - .js
  - .json
  - .qext
  - .txt
  - .xml
  - .yml

**Example:**

```js
console.log('Extension @@pkg.name, version @@pkg.version');
```

given the following package.json

```js
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "version": "0.1.2"
}
```

will return

```js
Extension my-extension, version 0.1.2
```

```js

```

**Using data from package.json**

All keys from your package.json file are available out of the box if you use the prefix `pkg`

* To get the version, use `@@pkg.version`
* To the get name, use `@@pkg.name`
* etc.

**Builtin patterns**

The following patterns are available out of the box:

`@@timestamp` - Defaults to new Date().getTime()

**Adding replacement patterns**

Add new replacements patterns in your .sense-go.yml file:

(tbd)

### Uglify

> Uglify & minifies JavaScript files

**`uglify:tmp`**

* Uglify all JavaScript files.
* Options:
  - `tmpDir`
  - `uglify*` - All options directly passed to `gulp-uglify`, e.g.
    + `uglify.mangle`
    + `uglify.beautify`
    + `uglify.preserveComments`

* Excluded:
  - All files matching the pattern `*.min.js`

### Wbfolder

> Create a wbfolder.wbl file to be used in Workbench/Qlik Dev Hub

**`gulp wbfolder`**
* Creates a wbfolder.wbl file in  the `.tmp` directory.
* Options used:
  - `wbfolder.cwd` - Working directory
  - `wbfolder.src` - Source mask
  - `wbfolder.dest` - Wbfolder.wbl file destination

## Task Chains

Based on gulp tasks provided by **_sense-go_** you can then create your task chains.
Some are already predefined:

**`gulp build`**

```js
  gulp.task( 
    'build', 
    gulp.series( 
      'init', 
      'clean:tmp', 
      'copy:toTmp', 
      'replace:tmp', 
      'clean:buildDev', 
      'copy:tmpToDev', 
      'clean:localExtensionDir', 
      'deploy:tmpToLocal' 
      )
  );`
```

## Create your own task-chains

You can add additional tasks on top of sense-go, mixing your very own tasks with sense-go tasks, etc.

* Always initialize a task chain with the `init` task
* When creating your own tasks, note that sense-go relies on Gulp4

**Example:**

```js
'use strict';
var gulp = require('gulp');
var senseGo = require('./lib/');

var userConfig = {
    "packageName": "sense-go"
};

senseGo.init( gulp, userConfig,  function (  ) {
  
  // Create your own task chain, and overwrite the current 'build' task
  gulp.task( 'build', gulp.series( 
    'init', 
    'clean:tmp', 
    'copy:toTmp', 
    'myTask1', 
    'myTask2' 
  ) );
    
});
```
