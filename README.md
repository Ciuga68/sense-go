# sense-go

> Library to easily handle validation, deployment, packaging and testing of Qlik Sense Visualization Extensions.

**Note: This library is in development and not ready to use, yet**

## Purpose

Main purpose of this library is to provide a framework to easily

+ validate
+ package
+ deploy and
+ test

**Visualization Extensions** created for Qlik Sense.

The implementation is a based on the deployment functionality in the [Yeoman Generator for Visualization Extensions](https://github.com/stefanwalther/generator-qsExtension).
Technically sense-go is using a set of configurable gulp-plugins.

The main reason behind creating this library is that I am creating a lot of different visualization extensions for Qlik Sense, but in any of these projects I include some kind of deployment system (so far always using grunt). If I have to make changes to the general deployment approach I have to change every single visualization extension repository, which is not really ideal. So introducing this library centralizes the deployment needs and allows me to re-use a central approach.
